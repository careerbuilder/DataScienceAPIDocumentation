Semantic Search API V2 
=====================

The semantic search API supports two endpoints: /query and /document.
The /query endpoint interprets and provides related entities for queries.
The /document endpoint parses a document, either a job or resume, and returns the most relevant semantic entities.

- [Query Request Information](#query-request-information)

# Query Description

Interprets the meaning of a user's query. Used to parse a query into the intended phrases, to identify the type of entities being searched for (job title, skill, company, location, etc.), and to identify the most related other phrases/entities that help better represent the intended query. This service also applies stored user overrides to queries when user parameters are supplied in conjunction with the Semantic Overrides API. 


# Query Request Information


HTTP method: GET or POST
Parameters (query/form):
-	query (required) : query to parse and from which to infer meaning.
-	language (optional) : two letter language code followed by underscore, followed by two letter country code. Determines the language in which enrichments are returned. Required to use personalized overrides. Defaults to en_us. Currently, allowed values are en_us, en_gb, fr_fr, de_de, and nl_nl.
-	user_id (optional) : user id for which to look up personalized overrides. Defaults to null. 
-	relationships_threshold : the mimimum weight of a relationship entity to be added as enrichments. Can be used to prune the result size. Defaults to 0.5. Allowed values are any number between 0 and 1.
 
Example 2.0 request: 
```
HTTP GET
Accept: application/json;version=2.0
https://api.careerbuilder.com/core/semanticsearch/query?query=registered%20nurse&language=en_us&user_id=U1234
```

# Query Response

The query response is divided into two parts. First is the parsed_input node, which gives information about parsing of extracted keywords in the query (this node is missing in the document response).
Second is the extracted_keywords node, which gives the type and related entities of each extracted keyword. Enrichments can be overridden to be returned with a selected=true flag for a given user_id through the Overrides API.

# Document Description

Used to parse a job or resume into its most important features and to represent these as a prioritized list of features that can be used to form a matching query.

# Document Request Information

HTTP method: POST.

Parameters:
-	language (optional) : two letter language code followed by underscore, followed by two letter country code. Determines the language in which enrichments are returned. Required to use personalized overrides. Defaults to en_us. Currently, allowed values are en_us, en_gb, fr_fr, de_de, and nl_nl.
-	user_id (optional) : user id for which to look up personalized overrides. Defaults to null. 
-	relationships_threshold : the mimimum weight for a relationship entry to be added as enrichment. Can be used to prune the result size. Defaults to 0.5. Allowed values are any number between 0 and 1.
-	document (required) : base64 encoded string of the document to be parsed.
-	type (required) : the type of the document. Acceptable values are "JOB" and "RESUME".
-	job_title (optional, only valid when type is JOB) : a pre-defined job title which overrides the job_title field extracted from a job document. Note that the job_title field will also be cleaned.
-	location (required, only valid when type is JOB): location for a job document, could be vacancy or company location.

Example 2.0 request:
```
HTTP POST
Accept: application/json;version=2.0
https://api.careerbuilder.com/core/semanticsearch/document
{

	"document": "SmF2YSBkZXZlbG9wZXIKCkNvbXBhbnk6IENhcmVlckJ1aWxkZXIKTG9jYXRpb246IEF0bGFudGEsIEdlb3JnaWEKCgpBcHBseSBub3chIFRoYW5rIHlvdSBmb3IgYXBwbHlpbmcuCg==",
	"location": "200 N LaSalle St, Chicago"
	"relationships_threshold": "0.9"
}
```

# Document Response

The document response includes the following parts. First is the `parsed_input` node which contains information on all extracted keywords and phrases. Next is the `semantic_keywords` node, which gives the name, type and relationships of all extracted phrases. The response may also include additional objects such as `job_titles`, `location`, `geographies`. These objects are derived from parsing the job or resume document, and may not appear when the supplied document lacks corresponding information.
