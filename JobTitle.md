# Request Information

HTTP method: GET or POST (form or JSON)

Parameters:

* `taxonomy` (required) : classification taxonomy to use; accepted values are listed [here](#taxonomies).

* `title` (required if description is empty) : job title
* `description` (required if title is empty) : job description

Possible taxonomies (with links to full taxonomy results)

| Taxonomy | description |
|----------|--------------|
| [onet17](https://github.com/cbdr/DataScienceAPITaxonomies/blob/master/JobTitle/oNet17.md) | Updated ONets |
| [carotenev3](https://github.com/cbdr/DataScienceAPITaxonomies/blob/master/JobTitle/CaroteneV3.md) | Changes from Carotene v2.2 include 7 removals, 139 updates, and 1,386 new titles.  <br> [CaroteneV2_2ToV3CrossWalk.md](https://github.com/cbdr/DataScienceAPITaxonomies/blob/master/JobTitle/CaroteneV2_2ToV3CrossWalk.md)<br> [Carotenev2.2 to v3 Crosswalk.xlsx](https://github.com/cbdr/DataScienceAPITaxonomies/blob/master/JobTitle/Carotenev2.2%20to%20v3%20Crosswalk.xlsx)|
| [carotenev3.1](https://github.com/cbdr/DataScienceAPITaxonomies/blob/master/JobTitle/CaroteneV3.1.csv) | Changes from Carotene v3 include 4 additions, 78 updates, and 28 removals.

| carotenev3.3_us | Carotene taxonomy based on a deep-learning approach (v3.1 is hierarchal) for improved prediction of SOC major. This taxonomy was trained with U.S.-specific data.
| carotenev3.3_uk | Same as _carotenev3.3_us_, but trained with data specific to U.K.

Complete taxonomy lists can be found [here](https://github.com/cbdr/DataScienceAPITaxonomies/tree/master/JobTitle) (restricted to CBReadOnly).

# Versioning
-----------
JobTitle versions the API contract and taxonomies separately. The API version controls the format of the API call and response. The taxonomy version controls what data is returned for the call. The current API version is 1.0.

Both the Carotene and ONet taxonomies are strongly and immutably versioned. For both systems, the underlying classifiers may occasionally be updated without a version change. This may slightly change the classification results for some inputs, but will not affect the underlying taxonomy data.

Our general versioning strategy is available [here](/Versioning.md).
