Semantic Search API V2 (Under Revision)
=====================

The semantic search API supports two endpoints: /query and /document.
The /query endpoint interprets and provides related entities for queries.
The /document endpoint parses a document, either a job or resume, and returns the most relevant semantic entities.

# Query Description

Interprets the meaning of a user's query. Used to parse a query into the intended phrases, to identify the type of entities being searched for (job title, skill, company, location, etc.), and to identify the most related other phrases/entities that help better represent the intended query. This service also applies stored user overrides to queries when user parameters are supplied in conjunction with the Semantic Overrides API. 


# Query Request Information


HTTP method: GET or POST
Parameters (query/form):
-	query (required) : query to parse and from which to infer meaning.
-	language (optional) : two letter language code followed by underscore, followed by two letter country code. Determines the language in which enrichments are returned. Required to use personalized overrides. Defaults to en_us. Currently, allowed values are en_us, en_gb, fr_fr, de_de, and nl_nl.
-	user_id (optional) : user id for which to look up personalized overrides. Defaults to null. 
-	relationships_threshold : the mimimum weight of a relationship entity to be added as enrichments. Can be used to prune the result size. Defaults to 0.5. Allowed values are any number between 0 and 1.
-   fields (optional) : a Json map that can pre-define a job title and/or a location overriding the parser output, for instance: `{"job_title":"Java Developer", "location":"New York"}`
 
Example 2.0 request: 
```
HTTP GET
Accept: application/json;version=2.0
https://api.careerbuilder.com/core/semanticsearch/query?query=registered%20nurse&language=en_us&user_id=U1234
```

# Query Response

The query response is divided into two parts. First is the parsed_input node, which gives information about parsing of extracted keywords in the query (this node is missing in the document response).
Second is the extracted_keywords node, which gives the type and related entities of each extracted keyword. Enrichments can be overridden to be returned with a selected=true flag for a given user_id through the Overrides API.

# Document Description

Used to parse a job or resume into its most important features and to represent these as a prioritized list of features that can be used to form a matching query.

# Document Request Information

HTTP method: GET or POST
Parameters (query/form):
-	language (optional) : two letter language code followed by underscore, followed by two letter country code. Determines the language in which enrichments are returned. Required to use personalized overrides. Defaults to en_us. Currently, allowed values are en_us, en_gb, fr_fr, de_de, and nl_nl.
-	user_id (optional) : user id for which to look up personalized overrides. Defaults to null. 
-	relationships_threshold : the mimimum weight for a relationship entry to be added as enrichment. Can be used to prune the result size. Defaults to 0.5. Allowed values are any number between 0 and 1.
-	document : the binary document to parse as base64 encoded string (according to RFC 3548/4648).
-	type : the type of document either "JOB" or "RESUME".
-   fields (optional) : a Json map that can pre-define a job title and/or a location overriding the parser output, for instance: `{"job_title":"Java Developer", "location":"New York"}`

Example 2.0 request:
```
HTTP GET
Accept: application/json;version=2.0
https://api.careerbuilder.com/core/semanticsearch/document
{
	"type": "JOB",
	"document": "SmF2YSBkZXZlbG9wZXIKCkNvbXBhbnk6IENhcmVlckJ1aWxkZXIKTG9jYXRpb246IEF0bGFudGEsIEdlb3JnaWEKCgpBcHBseSBub3chIFRoYW5rIHlvdSBmb3IgYXBwbHlpbmcuCg==",
	"relationships_threshold": "0.9"
}
```

# Document Response

The document response is divided into two parts. First is the parsed_input node which contains information on all extracted keywords and phrases. Next is the extracted_keywords node, which gives the name, type and relationships of all extracted phrases:

- data
	- parsed_input
		- input (list): comma-separated list of extracted keywords and phrases
		- parsed_fragments (list): input as list of strings
		- input_to_extracted_keywords (map): mapping extracted strings to canonical strings
	- extracted_keywords (list)
		- name (string): canonical name
		- weight (float): estimated weight (0-100)
		- type (string): skill, job_title, keyword, company, school, location, company_geography
		- entity_node (map of strings) (occurs only in the following types):
		    - location; possible fields: address, city, country, region, state, zip
		    - experience_level; possbiel fields: level, minYears, maxYears 
		- relationships (map of strings):
			- occupations (for type: job_title, skill, company, keyword)
			- related_keywords (for type: job_title, skill, company, keyword)
			- textkernel_related_keywords (for type: job_title, skill, company, keyword)
			- skills (for type: job_title, skill, company, keyword)
			- job_titles (for type: job_title, skill, company, keyword)
			- job_level (for type: job_title, skill, company, keyword)
			- education_level (for type:school)
	- versions (map): relationship strings mapped to version strings
