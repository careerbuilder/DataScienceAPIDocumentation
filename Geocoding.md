# Description

This service makes use of two different requests: Geocoding Requests and Google place ID lookup. The two request types represent two different methods of obtaining geographic information for a query (latitude/longitude, locality, administrative areas, country, etc.) and are explained in more detail below. This service relies on Google's Geocoding API as its data vendor; Google's service is documented [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro). Requests will be handled the same way regardless of HTTP method; use whichever method you find most convenient.

----------------------------
# Geocoding Request
A Geocoding request contains at least one of (query, address, locality, postal_code, admin_area, country) that must be provided in the query string.

### Headers and Version

Version must be specified in the ```Accept``` header.

E.g.: ```Accept: application/json;version=1.1```

See the [Versioning](#versioning) section for more information on Geocoding versioning.

### Request Structure

Example URL: https://api.careerbuilder.com/core/geography/geocoding?address=5550%20Peachtree%20Pkwy&locality=Norcross&admin_area=GA&postal_code=30092&country=US


| Parameter  | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| address      | Optional. A string containing address information, e.g. "5550 Peachtree Pkwy."" Other forms of location data may be passed in this field (such as postal codes or country names), but we recommend using the type-specific parameters when the location type of the data is known. This parameter is handled in the same way as the **query** parameter and the two cannot be used simultaneously. |
| query      | Optional. A string containing location information in any format, e.g. "5550 Peachtree Pkwy, Norcross, GA 30092.""  This parameter is handled in the same way as the **address** parameter and the two cannot be used simultaneously. **IMPORTANT NOTE:** We recommend using the type-specific parameters (**locality**, **admin_area**, **country**, etc) when the location type of the data is known, as that generally yields more accurate results. If you still need to resort to using this parameter, and especially if the request may not correspond to to a *fully specified street address*, you should be prepared to gracefully handle responses where certain fields (e.g. **locality**) are missing. See the notes on the **location_type** response field and the [Remarks and Recommendations](#remarks-and-recommendations). |
| locality   | Optional. The locality, such as the city or neighborhood, that corresponds to an address. |
| admin_area  | Optional. The subdivision name in the country or region for an address. This element is typically treated as the first order administrative subdivision, but in some cases it is the second, third, or fourth order subdivision in a country, dependency, or region. |
| country    | Optional. A country name or two-letter ISO-3166 country code. Used to limit the geographic scope of results to a particular country. Multiple pipe-delimited values may be supplied to limit results to a set of specified countries, e.g. ?query=Rome&country=IT&#124;US. |
| postal_code | Optional. The post code, postal code, or ZIP Code of an address. |
| culture    | Optional. The preferred ISO 639-1 language code for the response. If this parameter is omitted, the response will be returned in English. Note that the level of localization will vary for each culture. For example, the name "United States" may not have a localized name for every culture code. The geocoding service currently only supports a subset of the ISO-639-1 standard. Click [here](Data/GeocodingServiceSupportedLanguages.md) to view a full list of supported culture codes. |
| territories_as_states | Optional. When enabled, dependent territories may be requested as administrative areas of their parent nation, and will also be returned as such. This parameter is necessary to validate, for instance, **locality=San Juan&admin_area=PR&country=US**. This functionality will only recognize territories and parent countries by their [two-digit ISO-3166-1 country codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2), so requests such as **admin_area=Puerto Rico&country=USA** would not be remapped according to this parameter. Default value is false. |

# Place ID Lookup Request

A Google place ID is a unique identifier used by Google to identify locations/places in the Google Places Database and on Google Maps. The service accepts a valid place ID as a means to retrieve geographic information from Google via reverse geocoding. Requesting a location using a Google place ID requires that the request contains a place ID and a culture param if a language specification is desired. Additional location parameters will result in an HTTP 400 response.

Example URL: https://api.careerbuilder.com/core/geography/geocoding?culture=en&place_id=ChIJd8BlQ2BZwokRAFUEcm_qrcA

| Parameter  | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| place_id | Required. Id provided by google that uniquely identifies locations based on the Google Places Database and in Google Maps.
| culture    | Optional. The preferred ISO 639-1 language code for the response. If this parameter is omitted, the response will be returned in English. Note that the level of localization will vary for each culture. For example, the name "United States" may not have a localized name for every culture code. The geocoding service currently only supports a subset of the ISO-639-1 standard. Click [here](Data/GeocodingServiceSupportedLanguages.md) to view a full list of supported culture codes. |

# Response Structure

All responses with an HTTP status of 200 will consist of a JSON object with a top-level "data" node containing the following elements:

| Field    | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| results  | A JSON array of one or more objects containing geography data. If the request returns no results, the array will be empty. |
| expiration_date | A date string in YYYY-MM-DD format representing the last day that this data may be used. Per our contract with Google, any data cached by users of the geocoding service must be discarded by this date.

&nbsp;

Each element of the returned **results** array will be formatted as follows:

|   |   |
|---|---|
| admin_areas | A JSON array of up to 5 admin_area objects. See below for details on the structure of these objects. **This property is always present, but may be empty** if no admin areas were found. |
| latitude | A double value specifying the location's latitude (in degrees) within the range [-90, +90]. **This property is always present.** |
| longitude | A double value specifying the location's longitude (in degrees) within the range [-180, +180]. **This property is always present.** |
| country | The country or region name of an address. **This property may be absent** if the location was not associated with a country. Some locations for which this occurs are "Europe", "Pacific Ocean", and "Gaza Strip" (a contested territory). |
| locality | The populated place for the address. This typically refers to a city, but may refer to a suburb or a neighborhood in certain countries. **This property may be absent**. |
| postal_code | The post code, postal code, or ZIP code of an address. **This property may be absent**. |
| country_code | The two-letter ISO country code. **This property may be absent**. See "Country" for examples of when this might occur. |
| formatted_address| A string containing the human-readable address of this location. Often this address is equivalent to the "postal address," which sometimes differs from country to country. (Note that some countries, such as the United Kingdom, do not allow distribution of true postal addresses due to licensing restrictions.) **This property may be absent**. |
| location_type | The classification of the geographic entity returned. Possible values (in descending order of specificity) are STREET_ADDRESS, SUBLOCALITY, POSTAL_CODE, LOCALITY, ADMIN_AREA_2, ADMIN_AREA_1, STREET, COUNTRY, and UNKNOWN. The returned location type will reflect the most specific field present, based on the previously described order. If none of these fields are present (such as for the examples for which the Country field is absent), then the returned location type will be Unknown. **This property is always present and non-empty.** |
| postcode_localities | A string array denoting all the localities contained in a postal code. **This property is only present when the result is a postal code that contains multiple localities,** and will never be empty (nor will it ever contain only one element). |
| street_address | The official street line of an address relative to the area, as specified by the `locality` or `postal_code` properties. **This property may be absent**. |
| sublocality | The neighborhood, borough, township, etc. for the address. Sublocalities are typically more specific than cities and may be returned even if the locality field is empty. **This property may be absent**. |
| landmark | The full name of the landmark (such as a military base or island) returned by the service. **This property may be absent**. |
| place_id | Google's unique identifier string corresponding to the returned location. |
| viewport | A bounding box describing a rectangle that encloses the location. The viewport field contains two coordinate objects -- **northeast** and **southwest** -- each with **lat** and **lng** decimal values. It also contains a **suggested_radius** decimal field that contains the distance in miles from the center of the viewport to a corner. **This property and its elements are always present and non-empty.** |
| metropolitan_statistical_area | The metropolitan statistical area containing the location. An object containing two fields, the title of the area and an integer code for the area. Metropolitan statistical areas are specific to the US. **This property may be absent**. |
| designated_market_areas | An object array of the designated market areas containing the location. Designated market areas may overlap and thus a location may be in more than one designated market area. Designated market areas are specific to the continental US. See below for details on the structure of these objects. **This property may be absent and the array may be empty**. |
| partial_match | A Boolean value that, when true, indicates that the geocoder did not return an exact match for the original request, though it was able to match part of the requested address. You may wish to examine the original request for misspellings and/or an incomplete address.<br>Partial matches most often occur for street addresses that do not exist within the locality you pass in the request. Partial matches may also be returned when a request matches two or more locations in the same locality. For example, "21 Henr St, Bristol, UK" will return a partial match for both Henry Street and Henrietta Street. Note that if a request includes a misspelled address component, the geocoding service may suggest an alternative address. Suggestions triggered in this way will also be marked as a partial match. **This property is always present.** |

&nbsp;

Each element of the returned **admin_areas** array will be formatted as follows:

|   |   |
|---|---|
| short_name | The abbreviated form of the administrative area's name. This will vary by country and administrative division level. In the US, states (admin_area level 1) will use the state abbreviation (e.g. "GA"), and counties will use the full county name (e.g. "Gwinnett County"). **This property is always present and non-empty.** |
| long_name | The unabbreviated form of the administrative area's name. **This property is always present and non-empty.** |
| level | An integer between 1 and 5 inclusive specifying the hierarchal level at which this administrative area resides. In the US, states will be returned with a level of 1 and counties with a level of 2. **This property is always present and non-empty.** |

&nbsp;

Each element of the returned **designated_market_areas** array will be formatted as follows:

|   |   |
|---|---|
| name | The name of the DMA, e.g. "Atlanta, GA." **This property is always present and non-empty.** |
| id | The integer ID of the DMA. E.g. for the Atlanta, GA DMA, the ID is 524. **This property is always present and non-empty.** |

# Remarks and Recommendations

One common use case of the geocoding API is in normalizing location queries for search purposes. Occasionally, such applications may have the design goal of performing a "contained-in" search for some entities, such as states and countries ("return all results in Texas"), and for other entities, performing a radius search ("return all results within N mi/km of this point). If this describes your use case, the following logic is recommended:

|   |   |
|---|---|
| country | **Contained-in search.** |
| admin_area_1 or admin_area_2 | **Contained-in search.** These entities typically represent larger regions such as states, provinces, or counties. |
| admin_area_3 and below | **Radius search.** In the United States, third-level administrative areas represent US townships, which are more similar in size and function to towns or cities than to counties or states. In other countries, third-level administrative areas and below typically represent similar location types. |
| locality or sublocality | **Radius search.** |
| postal_code | **Radius search.** |
| street or street_address | **Radius search.** |

# Versioning
The current API version is 1.1. The data returned from the service is unversioned.  

Geography is constantly changing as postal codes, cities, states, and countries are created and destroyed.  Google, our vendor, doesn't publish an update policy and changes things as they see fit.

Our general versioning strategy is available [here](/Versioning.md).
