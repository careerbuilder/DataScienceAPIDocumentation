#Summary
__________

The service is located at https://api.careerbuilder.com/core/parsing/resume. As usual, you will need OAuth core credentials to use this service. (*If you do not have these please contact API and Auth to request credentials*)

Here is an example input: https://api.careerbuilder.com/core/parsing/resume?document=BASE64EncodedDocument

This service accepts POST Requests

We accept .DOC, .DOCX, .PDF, .RTF, .TXT, .ODT, and .WPS documents given in a BASE64 encoded string (Required)

The corresponding output is to careerbuilder API standards, with the data node holding all resume data.

Input Data
==========

Input should be provided in the POST request body, and content type should be either JSON or Form Vars (xml is not accepted)

document: We accept .doc, .docx, .pdf, .rtf, .txt, .odt, and .wps documents given in a BASE64 encoded string. Documents may not exceed 17,000 characters in length; those that do will incur an HTTP 413 Request-Entity Too Large error. This character limit includes spaces, but not include tabs or newlines.

*All documents that contain Greek as their primary language or are sent with the service=hireability parameter must be 65 characters or more. Any document that does not meet this threshold will return a 400 Bad Request exception.*

Note that image files (including scanned resumes) are not supported at this time.

language: ISO 639-1 language code (i.e. en, en-gb, es-419), this is used if a service is not specified to determine the parsing service we wish to use. (optional)

service: The title of the resume parsing service you wish to use (currently available are "textkernel", "hireability", & "daxtra") (Optional) (This field is case sensitive)

output_type: allows you to control the output either json (default) or xml

Possible Response Status Codes
=========================

ALL 4xx status codes should not be retried. ALL 5xx status codes should be retried.

#Versioning
-----------
The data returned is unversioned. The current version is 1.0. We expect that each of our vendors return the same data for repeated calls, however we have not verified this systematically.  We will occasionally update our vendors which may change the output.  If we believe this change is significant we will communicate about it.  However, customers will not be able to specify vendor versions; we will not be running multiple versions of a parser.  The language to parser mapping is unversioned.  We will update it as we understand each vendor's capabilities more fully.  If you need to stay on the same parser, please specify it explicitly.

Our general versioning strategy is available [here](/Versioning.md).
